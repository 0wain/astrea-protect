# Astrea Protect
An open source [Astrea](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/astrea-toolbox-server-essentials) module with the intent to provide an alternative to the likes of eProtect. 

## What is it?
Astrea Protect is a module for [Astrea](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/astrea-toolbox-server-essentials) that attempts to provide some basic but essential exploit protection for your server.

No need to dig through configs and restart your server after you catch someone exploiting.

## What does it include?
- Net Message rate limiting.
- Net Message logging.
- [To Do] Known exploit patching.
- [To Do] Anti-family share.
- [To Do] Honey pots.
- [To Do] HTTP Logging.
